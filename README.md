# Project : Landing Page
The Odin Project Landing Page Project Assignement

## Introduction
This aim at building an actual landing page with HTML5 and CSS3. The design reference file is available [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png). This will be the first project that I'll build from scratch and it'll be a solid challenge.

## Description and Goals
The main goal is to replicate the design reference given but it's also possible to add some jazz to it by adding real images and changing colors.
This is how i'll segment the project :
- [X] Setup the folders and files
- [X] Adding the basic boilerplate to html / css
- [X] Basic HTML element structure
- [X] Setting up the layout
- [X] Adding more styles
- [ ] Improvements, fixes and polish

## Learning Outcomes
This real life example will challenge everything I've learn so far. I eager to work around the layout as it's one of the thing I feel like needed work. The use of flexbox and container to setup the landing page will improve my understanding of the flow.

## Review
Struggled with spacing and flex grow. Often I inverted the padding short property. Otherwise project is interesting.
